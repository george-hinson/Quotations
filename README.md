# Quotations
Quotations with which I've experienced a moment of enjoyment and consideration.

## Quotes.md
These are the quotes that have been shared in my QOTD slack channel to date.

## Purpose
I have a facination of quotes. To me there is simply something alluring about the single thought, written and then perpetuated as a thing unto itself.

Mindfulness defined as either:
1. the quality fo state of being conscioius or aware of something
2. a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledgin and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique

In the mornings I present a 'Quote of the Day' via a Slack channel to some small cross-section of colleagues. My goal is to provide the means to a moment. A brief time near the start of the day when a moment of contemplation around a thought originating somehwere entirely external to one's own mind.

Another inspiration leading me to do present this daily quote is, as taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QOTD:

  > The Quote of the Day (QOTD) service is a member of the Internet protocol suite, defined in RFC 865. As indicated there, the QOTD concept predated the specification, when QOTD was used by mainfram sysadmins to broadcast a daily quote on request by a user.
  > It was then formally codified both for prior purposes as well as for testing and measurement purposes.

  > A host may connect to a server that supports the QOTD protocol, on either TCP or UDP port 17.
  > To keep the quotes at a reasonable length, RFC 865 specifies a maximum of 512 octets for the quote.

  > ALthough some sources indicate that the QOTD service is rarely enabled, and is in any case often firewalled to avoid 'pingpong' attacks, interest continues in the pre-existing purpose of serving quotes as can be seen with web engine searches.

  > Current testing and measurement of IP networks is more commonly done with ping and traceroute, which are more robust adaptations of the echo protocol (RFC 862), which predated the attempt at QOTD standardization.
